## Description
This application was designed and built to solve my issue of having items in the pantry/fridge but not knowing what meals I can make with the items at hand. The user can input their items and the RubyRecipe application will search the database for the most relevant recipes for those items.

## Installation

If you have ruby installed on your computer there are a few steps to get RubyRecipe up and running.

1. Download the git repo and run bundle install from the folder and this will install all the gems and their dependencies.

```ruby
bundle install 
```

2. Then to launch the application all you need to do is run this code in your terminal.

```ruby
ruby intro.rb
```

3. Enjoy!
